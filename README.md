The main focus of this mod is a custom Power system in wich players can find the favor of old gods and use their powers.

The main point was to give each player a unique power. So each player can only gain the favor of one god and each god can give its favor only to one player.

***

This mod was made specifically for a server i wanted to play on with friends, so some features may be a bit out of scope and just included for fun/as a reference to freinds.

## Content

### Main Mechanic

While playing normaly you can sometimes perform actions that make a specific god take notice of you.

*   They will offer you their power, give you a small boon and a quest to unlock more of their power.
*   When you recieve the power you are bound to that god.
*   When you finish their quest your power is awoken.
*   When an awoken player kills another awoken player he can gain the ascended status.
*   An ascended player that is killed by a player that is atleast awoken, becomes only awoken again.

##### **Bound:**

being bound gives you a small passive buff related to your god.

##### **Awoken:**

while being awoken you can use a keybind and and a golden idol in your inventory to use an ability related to your god.

##### **Ascended:**

while being ascended you can use a keybind and a blessed idol in your inventory to use an ascension/ultimate ability.

## The Two Main Gods

There are two extra roles. These cannot be obtained randomly and must be set in the config. They also dont ascend through killing but through actions of other players.

*   The Yellow King is intended to be the main antagonist of the server. This role is meant to remain secret at the beginning and be discovered during gameplay.
*   The Lunar Maiden is intended to be the server admin role.

If you only want to use the power system, you can set the config values to player names that are not part of the server.

### The King in Yellow — God of the Sun

*   Passive: You count as the King in Yellow.
*   Ability: Summon a minion.
*   Ascension: Transport yourself and another creature into the core of the sun for a one-on-one fight.

### The Lunar Maiden — God of the Moon

*   Passive: None.
*   Ability: Summon a small moon beam.
*   Ascension: Banish a creature to the moon for a limited time.
